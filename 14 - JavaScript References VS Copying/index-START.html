    let age2 = age;

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.  
    const teams = players;
    console.log(players, teams)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // teams[3] = 'lux'; //THIS IS A REFERENCE TO THE ORIGINAL ARRAY NOT A COPY
    console.log(players, teams)
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const teams2 = players.slice(); //slice always creates a copy
    console.log(teams2);
    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const teams3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(teams3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const teams4 = [...players];
    const teams5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    console.log(teams4);
    console.log(teams5);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    console.log(person)
    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(person)
    // console.log(captain)
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99, age:12})
    console.log(cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
